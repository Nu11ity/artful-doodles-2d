# Artful Doodles

This repository contains a collection of simple game character and environment art created using basic primitives and shapes. These artworks were developed as part of my learning process to master a new technique for creating game art. The main focus of this project is to explore how simple shapes and primitives can be combined to produce visually appealing and expressive game assets.

## Artwork

The repository includes the following artwork pieces:
